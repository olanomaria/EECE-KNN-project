Group 7: KNN (k nearest neighbors) Depending on the method of treating the data:
1. If the data is manually inserted into code, then download the final version of the Python file and run it
2. If treating the data implicates the use of CSV and Pandas, then an additional Excel file will be provided to download. The file will consist of a table with data on a set of points or 
   instances with variying attributes. Once downloaded, make sure to have the file's path and directory to implement in Python. Note: A single method will be settled on later, and the README 
   file will be edited appropriately. This is a demonstration on how the description and instructions would look.
